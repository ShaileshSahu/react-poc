1. what do props helps us accomplish?
Make more components usuable and reusable?.


2. How do you pass a props into a component?
<MyAwesomeHeader title=""/>

3. Can I pass a custom porp )e.g 'blal = {true}) to native dom lements?
No, becuase JSX we use to desvibe native DOM will be turned into real dom elements by
react. And real dom element only have the properties/attrivutes speicifed in the
html speicifeditor.
