1. What is react component?

It's basically the same as small piece of code having the declarative flow.

2. What is wrong with this code?

function myComponent() {
    return (
        <small>I'm tiny text!!</small>
    )
}

It's should be namedas MyComponent otherwise react will treat
as a simple function not component.

3. what's wrong with this code?
function Header() {
    return (
        <header>
        <nav>
        <img src=''/>
        </nav>
        </header>
    )
}

ReactDOM.render(Header(), document.getElementById("root"));



It shoulde be <Header/> insted of Header()!!
